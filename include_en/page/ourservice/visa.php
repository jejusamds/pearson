				<p class="title ty02 ty03">Work Permit Options for Foreign Professionals & Businesspeople</p>
				<p class="txt">The Singapore government has a choice of work permits or visas in the offering. These sprawl across less-skilled workers to well-educated and seasoned professionals, who come under P1 and P2 category. For those foreign professionals who intend to work or set up businesses in Singapore, here is a short overview on the types of Singapore Work Visa, Entrepreneur Passes and other Immigration Services.</p>
				<div class="box">
					<p class="txt bold">1.	Employment Pass (EP)</p>
					<p class="txt">This is the most popular type of work visa, also called Singapore EP pass or Singapore E pass. By securing this pass foreign entrepreneurs, directors, general managers, shareholders and skilled professionals can live and work in Singapore for at least a year. It is valid for up to 2 years for first timers. The <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/employment-pass/eservices-and-forms" target="_blank">Singapore Employment Pass</a> can be renewed provided the pass holder is an employee of the company. After renewal, it is valid up to three years. For eligibility, the minimum monthly salary is S$3,600 or more.</p>
					<p class="txt mt15 bold">2.	Entrepreneur Pass (EntrePass):</p>
					<p class="txt">The Entrepreneur Pass, also known as the EntrePass, is a visa that facilitates foreigners to work and live in Singapore for up to 1 to 2 years. This is most convenient for foreign entrepreneurs, intending to set up a new business in Singapore. A few standards rule the application of this pass, such as the candidate must have a minimum of 30% of the total shares of the company. Likewise, the company’s share capital must have a minimum value of S$50,000. Beginning 1st September 2013, Singapore Ministry of Manpower has introduced drastic changes to the eligibility criteria for the EntrePass scheme. Provided the criteria defined by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower are adequately fulfilled, these pass holders can travel in and out of Singapore without a hitch. For them, the Singapore immigration process becomes trouble-free. The Singapore Entrepreneur Pass has to be renewed every month.</p>
