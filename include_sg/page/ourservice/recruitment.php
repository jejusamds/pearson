					<p class="inc event">Foreign entrepreneurs starting business in Korea often struggle with finding the right local labor who can assist their business activities in a new environment. Fortunately, in Korea, there are many competent prospective local employees seeking job opportunities. The unemployment rate for the young Koreans is as high as ever with over 10%. This is partly due to continuous low economic growth rate and lack of innovation in existing industries. However, lots of experts point out that the mismatch between the supply side and demand side of the labor market is the main cause of unprecedented high youth unemployment rate. <br><br>We provide services to remedy this inefficient mismatch. Our goal is to help foreign entrepreneurs find talented local employees, while providing young Koreans the opportunity to work with promising foreign-invested enterprises. In the process, Pearson & Partners functions as a medium between foreign-invested enterprises and young job seekers & experienced professionals. To achieve that goal, we utilize both offline and online means and sources. The following diagram illustrates our recruitment services.</p>
