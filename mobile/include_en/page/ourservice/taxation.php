				<p class="txt">A tax treaty is an agreement signed between two nations to decide the taxation of the income earned by the authorities of two nations, in the case of a company running businesses in both nations. An income tax treaty is signed so that businesses do not have to pay double taxes on their income. Singapore has signed tax treaties with more 80 countries and number is consistently on the rise.<br /><br />
				Every company that has earned from countries that do not have double tax agreement with Singapore, will be given a tax credit on their income from those countries.<br />
